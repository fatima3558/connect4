User Story:

User should be able to:
	-see board with all pieces in play
	-identify when it's their turn vs their opponents'
	see an indication of 4 tiles being connected and of the game being won
	select a row to drop their tile into
	-pick a color for their tiles

Beyond MVP goals:
	-see a timer for them to make a decision about their next move
	-add a drop animation
	-create an option that each player can use once, in which
		-a spinner appears
		-the spinner spins and lands on one of two options:
			-either the spinner allows the color of the tiles in play to switch, or 
			-the tiles in play stay the same
		-this would allow a player at a disadvantage to turn the tables by changing the color of the favorably situated tiles to match their color
